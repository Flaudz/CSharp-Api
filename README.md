#### What to do now
I will update this so it can be used as a guide for a starter api, but i think for now that i only have a hour left before school is over that i will direct you to [the Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio). I had some issues when i did this first so that's why i made this guide on how to do it, it should fix the issues you would have ran into if you did not do this.

**-- Will be updatet in the future**
